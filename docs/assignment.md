# Self-Study Assignment: Systems Theory
**Course:** Systems Theory (Doctoral Program)  
**Year:** 2025-2026

## The Task

### 1. Linear Control System Analysis (ACS)
Make a description of the object (system) of doctoral research in terms of models of automatic control systems (ACS):

* **Structural Diagram:** Create a structural diagram of the ACS, defining its elements and their interpretation.
* **Transfer Functions (Elements):** Derive transfer functions of its elements (elementary links) in the linear approximation with a sufficient degree of simplification, together with the interpretation of their properties.
* **General Transfer Function:** Derive the general transfer function of the whole system.
* **Stability Analysis:** Estimate conditions of stability/instability of the system by analyzing the roots of the common characteristic equation of the system.

### 2. Nonlinear Dynamic Modeling
Build a nonlinear dynamic model for the object of doctoral research:

* **Model Selection:** Choose the most suitable nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) or a system of equations of no more than 2nd order (refer to analogs in economics, sociology, biology) which, in a first approximation, reflects the properties and behavior of the research object.
* **Geometric Analysis:** Perform local geometric analysis for it:
    * Find the number and coordinates of fixed points (equilibria).
    * Analyze their stability and classify them by types: "node", "focus", "saddle", or "center".

### 3. Chaos Theory & Time Series Analysis
Choose some dynamic indicator of the behavior of the doctoral research object (available time series with a length of **at least 1000 samples**).

* Calculate the **Hurst exponent**.
* Calculate the **Fractal (Correlation) Dimension**.
* Interpret the results (stochastic vs. chaotic vs. deterministic).

### 4. Reporting
All the results obtained should be brought together in a joint standard report in electronic form (PDF document) and uploaded on the course page for checking and grading.
