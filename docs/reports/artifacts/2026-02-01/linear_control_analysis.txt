Linear Control System (ACS) - Computed Quantities
=
Kp = 1.0
I_target = 1.0

Process: I(s) = (1/s) * (U(s) - D(s))
Controller: U(t) = Kp * (I_target - I(t))

Closed-loop transfer function (from I_target to I):
  G_cl(s) = Kp / (s + Kp)
  Numerator: [1.]
  Denominator: [1. 1.]

Characteristic equation: s + Kp = 0
Closed-loop poles:
  -1.0

Stability (all poles real parts < 0): True
