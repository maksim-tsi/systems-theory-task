# Golden Sample Analysis Report

Date: 2026-02-01

## Plan
1. Load the materialized golden sample from data/golden_sample.parquet.
2. Compute dataset integrity checks (rows, date range, hourly coverage).
3. Summarize sales/stockout/temperature/price statistics.
4. Profile hourly mean sales and hourly stockout rates.
5. Record observations and modeling implications.

## Observations
- Clear diurnal pattern: demand rises sharply around hours 6–10, then tapers after hour 16.
- Stockouts are concentrated in peak hours (6–10), with near-total stockouts at hour 7.
- Median hourly sales is 0.0, indicating many zero-sales hours even on active days.
- Price is uniformly 0.0 in this materialized sample, indicating the discount/price field may be missing or encoded as zero for this SKU.

## Modeling Implications
- Stockout-driven dynamics are strong during morning demand spikes; nonlinear decay and stockout handling should capture this regime.
- The zero-valued price feature should be treated as missing or replaced with a neutral value if the downstream model expects positive pricing.
- Temperature variation is modest; it can be included as a weak exogenous driver.

## Next Steps
- Validate pricing signal in source dataset and decide imputation strategy (e.g., replace 0.0 with 1.0 or drop).
- Generate plots (hourly demand, stockout rates, daily totals) in src/visualization.py.
- Feed this series into the linear and nonlinear model pipelines and compare fit quality.
