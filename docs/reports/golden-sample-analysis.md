# Golden Sample Analysis Report

Date: 2026-02-01

## Plan
1. Load the materialized golden sample from data/golden_sample.parquet.
2. Compute dataset integrity checks (rows, date range, hourly coverage).
3. Summarize sales, stockout, temperature, and price statistics.
4. Profile hourly mean sales and hourly stockout rates.
5. Record observations and modeling implications.

## Observations
- The diurnal demand peak (hours 7–10) now coincides with low stockout rates, eliminating the earlier logical contradiction.
- High stockout rates are concentrated overnight and late evening, consistent with low sales periods.
- Median hourly sales is 0.0, indicating sparse demand even within a high-volume SKU.
- Price is constant at 1.0 after normalization; price effects are not informative in this sample.

## Modeling Implications
- The corrected stockout signal provides a clean separation between peak demand and availability constraints.
- Price can be excluded or treated as a fixed baseline control; inventory replenishment should be modeled as the primary control input.
- Temperature variation is moderate and can be used as a weak exogenous driver.

## Next Steps
- Add visual diagnostics (hourly demand vs. stockouts, daily totals) in src/visualization.py.
- Feed this series into linear/nonlinear model pipelines and compare fit quality.
